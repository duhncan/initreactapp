# First React Application

This is just me following a Youtube tutorial on how to make very simple React Application using components. 

A link to the Youtube video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk)

# Usage

To run for development purposes I used the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Setup

To begin the project I used the following commands:

```bash
npm create vite@latest # Using React & TypeScript
cd # into project name
npm install
npm run dev
```

Using bootstrap, I installed the relevant modules for it via:
```bash
npm i bootstrap@latest
```

# Tips
Using VSCode, I used the Prettier Extenstion and enabled formatting on save on via:

```bash
Settings -> Search 'format on save' -> Enable 'Editor: Format On Save'
```
